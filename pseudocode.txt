    When buttonsolve is pressed, I need to change correct input squares to green and incorrect input squares to red
    Add Easy, medium, and Hard levels
        //Easy = 1 to 2 squares missing per level, medium = 3 to 5 , hard = 6 to 8
        //add select button in right side of header with Difficulty written next to incorrect
        //Difficulty set to medium initially
